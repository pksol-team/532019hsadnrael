== Description ==

= Jivo Omnichannel Suite =

Finally! Live Chats, Emails, Calls and Facebook messages in one App

== Business Communicator for E-Commerce ==

Unlike other live chat apps on the Bigcommerce Market, Jivo is omnichannel. 

Well, what does that mean?
It means live chats on your website, chat support to clients on Facebook, messages to your company’s email address, and calls to a phone number in any country – all go to one convenient JivoChat app.

* Everything is in one place: your messages and chat history can be found in one inbox so there’s no need to sign up for multiple communication tools
* Too easy: your team can react quickly to all inquiries -- you don’t have to switch between apps to reply on different channels
* Sales booster: you can double your sales by increasing website conversion rates and building better customer service experiences.
