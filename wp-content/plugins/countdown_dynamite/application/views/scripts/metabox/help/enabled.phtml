If you insert a countdown shortcode in the page, the &quot;Enable countdown on this post&quot; option will be automatically selected.

But you want to check it manually, if you have selected to &quot;show this offer only once&quot; and you want this to be applied to your post or page (since the &quot;show this offer only once&quot; doesn't use shortcodes).
